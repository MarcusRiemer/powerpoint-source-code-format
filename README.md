# Powerpoint Source Code Formatter

Dealing with source code in Powerpoint is cumbersome. Pasting the sourcecode works for certain applications that fill the clipboard with RTF or HTML data, but keeping all sorts of snippets up to date is cumbersome. This plugin adds ribbon UI elements which run [pygments](https://pygments.org/) to apply syntax highlighting to selected texts or shapes.
